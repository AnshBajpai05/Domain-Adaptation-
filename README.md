# Domain-Adaptation-
This project explores unsupervised domain adaptation for visual recognition using MNIST, MNIST-M, and Office-31. Implemented SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Stacking, PCA, MMD, CORAL, and CNN to reduce domain shift, improve transferability, and boost accuracy across domains.
